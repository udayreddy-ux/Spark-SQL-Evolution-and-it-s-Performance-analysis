# Spark SQL Evolution and Performance analysis
This project, investigates the capabilities and performance efficiency of Spark SQL, highlighting its advanced query optimization through the Catalyst Optimizer. We conduct a comparative analysis between Spark SQL and traditional SQL engines, with a focus on runtime efficiency and the handling of structured and unstructured data. Employing an ecommerce dataset from Kaggle, our study covers scenarios such as schema creation, data loading, and detailed query processing, demonstrating Spark SQL’s effectiveness in large-scale data environments.

Our evaluation extends to Google Cloud's Dataproc service, where we benchmark Spark SQL against HiveQL to illustrate the superior performance and efficiency of Spark SQL in real-time data processing. The documentation outlines Spark SQL’s integration with various data sources, its real-time processing capabilities, and the sophisticated query optimization techniques it employs. By detailing the steps from initial setup to final execution analysis, we enable users to replicate our findings and explore the full potential of Spark SQL. Contributions to this research are welcome, reinforcing Spark SQL's prominence as a leading tool in the analytics and big data processing field.
